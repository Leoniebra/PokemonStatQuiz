This project is a silly little webpage, which lets the user guess pokemon based on the spread of their base stats.
We use pokemon showdowns battlePokedex object to quickly have a list of many pokemon available. 
This project is not intended for commerical use, and is just supposed to be a small game to play with my friends.
